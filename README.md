This is a project that I am working on in a class at Devry. This project is from DeVry's class - CEIS150 Programming with Objects. This class focuses on learning object-oriented programming techniques. We are using object oriented techniques to develop a stock trading application. By processing the historical stock data, profit loss/reports can be generated.

Week 2

The first entry of code I had to turn in began on week 2 of the class. In week two we focused on creating the classes needed to work with our stock and history data. We created some classes for the stock_class.py. We ran some unit testing code as well.

Week 3

For this week 3, we focused on creating a console-based interface for working with stocks and the stock price history. We created a menu driven user interface to add list and delete stocks and to track price and volume history.

Week 4

In week four we focused on inheritance and we implemented some inheritance techniques into the stock program. We made additional classes and files and we ran some unit tests. Noteworthy parts of this week were creating the code for our Retirement_Account class. Which included code for traditional and robo accounts.

Week 5

For this week, we used the pyplot class from the matplotlib library to create a chart showing stock prices over time.

Week 6

In week 6 we implemented the ability to load data from a csv file. We read data from the file as well.

Week 7

For this part of the project we created a GUI for our stock trading program. We used the tkinter library which is the interface for the Tk toolkit. The main reason we used this library is that it is cross-platform.
