This is a project that I am working on in a class at Devry. This project is from DeVry's class - CEIS150 Programming with Objects. This class focuses on learning object-oriented programming techniques. We are using object oriented techniques to develop a stock trading application. By processing the historical stock data, profit loss/reports can be generated.

Week 2
The first entry of code I had to turn in began on week 2 of the class. In week two we focused on creating the classes needed to work with our stock and history data. We built on this project week after week.

Week 3
For week 3, we focused on creating a console-based interface for working with stocks and the stock price history.
