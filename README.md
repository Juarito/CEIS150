# CEIS150 Python Stock Tracking Project

This repository contains my Python Stock Tracking Project developed for the CEIS150 course at DeVry University. Throughout this project, I expanded my programming skills by implementing core features in Python to create a fully functional stock tracking application. Each module in this project builds on the last, incorporating essential programming concepts and techniques to improve functionality and user experience. Below is an overview of each module's purpose and contents.

## Module 1: Introduction to Structured Programming and Review
In Module 1, I focused on refreshing my knowledge of structured programming principles with Python. This module involved reviewing key concepts such as sequence, selection, and iteration, which formed the basis for developing more complex object-oriented applications in subsequent modules.

## Module 2: Creating Basic Classes and OOP Foundations
Module 2 introduced object-oriented programming (OOP) by developing foundational classes for the stock tracking application. I created the `Stock` and `DailyData` classes, which included attributes to manage stock details, such as stock symbol, company name, and price history. This module provided a strong base for using OOP principles and laid the groundwork for future modules.

## Module 3: User Interface with a Menu-Driven System
In Module 3, I developed a console-based, menu-driven interface to make the application interactive. This interface allowed users to add, list, delete, and view stock price history. I created functions for each menu option, enabling basic stock management and data handling through user input. This module helped me better understand how to interact with users and structure the code for scalability.

## Module 4: Implementing Inheritance for Account Management
Module 4 involved implementing inheritance in the application by adding account management features. I created the `Retirement_Account` base class and derived two subclasses, `Traditional` and `Robo`, to allow users to choose different investment options. This module gave me practical experience in using inheritance to manage similar yet distinct classes, improving code efficiency and reusability.

## Module 5: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
In Module 5, I enhanced the application with data visualization by integrating the `matplotlib` library to create line charts. Using the `display_stock_chart()` function, I generated visual representations of stock price trends over time. This module reinforced my understanding of data visualization, which helped make the data more accessible and meaningful for users.

## Module 6: Importing Data from CSV Files
In Module 6, I added functionality to import historical stock data from CSV files, specifically using Yahoo! Finance data. The `import_stock_csv()` function enabled the program to read data directly from a CSV file and display it in the application, making it more versatile and data-driven. This module improved my skills in data handling and processing external file formats.

## Module 7: Building a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter
In Module 7, I replaced the console interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library. This final module allowed me to enhance user interaction by creating a GUI that includes tabs, buttons, and data displays. I implemented functions to manage stocks, view data history, generate reports, and display stock charts within the GUI. This module marked the completion of a full-featured, user-friendly stock tracking application.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries, including `matplotlib` and `tkinter` (included in Pythonâ€™s standard library).
3. Run `stock_GUI.py` for the full graphical experience, or `stock_menu.py` to interact with the console version.

## Conclusion
This project helped me gain practical experience with Python programming, especially with data management, visualization, and interface design. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for further development. Thank you for exploring my project!
